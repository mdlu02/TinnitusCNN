Hello! Here is the Python script I developed for training neural network models. I completed this project during my time in the 
University of California, San Francisco's Center for Intelligent Imaging Summer 2022 internship. I was mentored by Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan
and his team from UCSF's radiology department. While I cannot share the I used data used training (for HIPAA reasions), I hope that
this script can act as inspiration or a model to base your own deep learning project on. 

The type of data used were brain connectomes generated from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images. Inputs were in alpha, beta, theta,
delta, delta-theta, gamma, and higam channels. Models were trained separately and then fused into a parent model for final performance
metrics.
